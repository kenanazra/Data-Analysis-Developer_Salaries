## Project: Developer's Salaries
In this project, we analyze workforce data from Norway to explore the relationships between various factors such as Gender, Education, Experience, Workplace, Employment Status, Field, Salary, and Bonuses. The goal is to understand how these variables influence salaries and identify key trends in the Norwegian labor market.

## Questions
The Developer's Salaries dataset is very rich, and many questions could be posed here. The following are the suggested questions:

1. Where is the largest number of workers located?
2. In which Gender do we find the largest number of workers?
3. In which sectors do we find the largest number of workers?
4. What is the relationship between workplace and field?
5. What is the relationship between status and field?
6. What is the relationship between Experience and field?
7. What is the relationship between Employment and field?
8. What is the relationship between Education and field?
9. Where and in which employment status are most bonuses given?
    
## conclusions

These findings align with trends in the Norwegian labor market, where salaries are influenced by:

1. Technical skills and their market demand.
2. Geographical location, with major cities like Oslo offering higher wages.
3. Work experience, where salaries grow with professional advancement.
4. Education, which plays a role but is not the sole factor in determining salary.
5. Employment type, as freelancers tend to earn more than traditional employees.

These trends reflect Norway’s economic policies, which emphasize supporting freelance work, fostering technological growth, and maintaining a strong work-life balance.
